CHANGES since 20190910

v. 20260702
-------------
 - Fork created from ICTester (https://oldcomputer.info/software/ictester/index.html)
 - Try to make it work with modern low-cost hardware (Pico or maybe Uno Mega)

v. 20250712
-------------
 - Qt6 port (tested on Debian Trixie, Qt 6.8.2, Qt Creator 16.8.1). It will NOT build
   under Qt 4 or Qt 5! Use the previous version for Qt 5!
 - BUGFIX: The race condition in the chip editor (return key moves selection two times or 
   not) has been fixed... probably :-).
 - In this specific versions pin auto-coloring wildcards may work strange, this is a new 
   Qt's behaviour. You have been warned.

v. 20210823
-------------
 - 2111test tool.
 - Bugfix in sheet editor font selection.


v. 20200622 - NOT RELEASED
-------------
 - It is possible to select logger and ROM diagnostics font in the configuration which helps
   a little when HiDPI screen is used.
 - It is possible to change toolbar size which helps if a touchscreen is used.
 - A Start Test button can be placed in a toolbar which slightly improves touchscreen operation.
 - Bugfix - The IC preview in open window scales properly. Thanks to DP for noticing this bug.
 - Some work to make it more or less operating in Haiku OS. Whyt not? SerialPort library has
   still some inconsistencies.
 - Some of NULL->nullptr conversions for recent compiler screeches. A screeching about losing
   precision when converting unsigned Char to Byte will not be addressed until someone buys
   everyone a notebook with 640GB of RAM as the proposed solution literally chews 4 bytes per
   conversion.

Warning: No, this won't work in Qt6. There is no Serial Port library in it!

v. 20200411
-------------
 - Bugfix in external tools feature which allowed deleted items to presist in configuration
   file.
 - Added test for 93415 1kx1 S-RAM, this rare chip works usually as some "cache" in old arcade 
   machines and serial adapters.

v. 20191028
--------------
 - Introduced feature for automatic pin type setting in editor. If a wildcard is met, the pin
   type is just changed automatically according to specific wildcards. It is possible to set
   wildcards for Vcc, GND, Output and NC to speed up models development.
   If you don't want to change type, click it back after editing.
 - Added platform/build architecture information in boot screen.
 - Bugfix: Descriptions >49 characters not shown in preview. Now >129 are not shown.
 - Comments in files. Works, but comments may be lost when used with original software as its
   support for comments is scarce. Comments ending with ; are displayed in log so you can report
   what is tested. Comments with no ";" at the end are totally rescissed even from numbering.
 - ICTESTCON: Now it fails gracefully on Ctrl-C and shuts the voltage down. If hangs - kill -9.
      Not sure will this even work on Windows.
 - S-RAM test tools: Help clarified.
 - RAM modules with external tools, it is possible to send port, baudrate and timeout to external
   tool, manage them from config page.
   EXAMPLE of launching RAM test from arbitrary directory with space in name ("Dev Version" is a
   directory) and reset at the end (ends with !):
          xterm -e "/home/mcbx/Electronics/ICTester/Dev\ Version/2102test $P:$B"!
 - BUGFIX: Program shuts down when ENTER pressed sometimes in chip editor.
 - A new SRAM test tool: 6810test, for testing 6810 S-RAM chips (128x8bit).
