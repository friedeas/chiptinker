This program allows to test integrated circuits using EPE IC Tester in 
modern operating systems. It has also a built-in ROM/PROM/EPROM reader.
It is using the EPE IC tester hardware.


The hardware
--------------
 The hardware description can be found in the link below as 
 "Digital IC Tester":
 http://www.epemag3.com/lib/free-projects.html
 
 Firmware and source code of it, as well as test sheets and old (Win9x) 
 program:
 ftp://ftp.epemag.wimborne.co.uk/pub/PICS/ICtester/


Features
-----------
 - GUI and command-line based testing of logic ICs.
 - Creating and editing of test scripts and IC models using GUI.
 - Reading, comparing and verifying ROM/PROM/EPROM memory chips.
 - Adding new ROM/PROM/EPROM chips using GUI or text files
 - Testing 2114, 2102, 6810 and 6116 SRAM chips (command-line programs)
 - Qt powered - runs in Linux and Windows


Building the source code
--------------------------
Get a Qt development package for Your operating system distribution.
If you don't have Qt 5.x, you may need a Qt Serial Port library. For
Qt 4.x it's needed - see https://wiki.qt.io/Qt_Serial_Port
 In 5.x versions it usually comes built-in.
Then we can make the project. In Linux:
1. cd to the source directory (directory where "ICTester.pro" file is)
2. mkdir bin
3. cd bin
4. qmake ../ICTester.pro
5. make
You will get all binaries in the bin folder's subdirectories.
In Windows, it's nice to use Qt Creator. After importing project to 
your Qt just try to build it in release mode.


Known issues
--------------
Some 2716 chips are using strange signals which is not 100% compliant 
with TTL logic. These chips may be unstable during reading. To make 
sure that your ROM reads OK, after reading move it a little in socket 
and verify. Additionally old chips may suffer bit rot in lower voltage
caused by switching transistor - unfortunately in these cases it is 
needed to use a programmer with ability to bump the Vcc up a bit (e.g. 
to 5.5V or 6V) like Willem v. 3.0.

Because the tester has pull-up resistors, it can't verify one problem 
with outputs - when there is high state or nothing. This damage is 
very rare and can be verified using TTL probe.


Manual
----------
All instructions, informations and file formats descriptions can be 
read in HTML manual enclosed with source code in "doc" subdirectory.
